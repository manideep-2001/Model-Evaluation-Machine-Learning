# Model-Evaluation-Machine-Learning
Pridicting Heart Disease by using Machine Learning Algorithm. About Dataset

# The dataset contains the following features:

age(in years)
sex: (1 = male; 0 = female)
cp: chest pain type
trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl
fbs: (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
restecg: resting electrocardiographic results
thalach: maximum heart rate achieved
exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
target: 1 or 0
